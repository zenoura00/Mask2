      <h2>180-Day Money-Back Guarantee</h2>
      <p><strong>We offer a 180-day money-back guarantee.</strong> If you are not satisfied for any reason within 180 days of purchase, contact our support with your order number and we will process a full refund according to these terms:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Refund requests must be submitted within 180 calendar days from the purchase date.</li>
        <li>Submit refund request to the email/contact provided on the order confirmation, including order number and reason.</li>
        <li>We may request photos or additional information to process the return. In most cases, we will approve and issue a refund without requiring return shipping, but the return process may vary per merchant or fulfillment partner.</li>
        <li>Refunds are processed within 7–14 business days after approval. The refund will be issued to the original payment method.</li>
